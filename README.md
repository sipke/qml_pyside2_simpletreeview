# qml_pyside2_simpletreeview

    Port of simpletreeview created based on
    https://github.com/baoboa/pyqt5/blob/master/examples/itemviews/simpletreemodel/simpletreemodel.py
    and using qml files rather than resource files.
    and a bunch of other modifications to make things work for pyside2.
    Multiselect was enabled, unlike the original example.

For what the example is refer also https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-itemviews-simpletreemodel-example.html
